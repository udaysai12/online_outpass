before starting python you have to know about what is coding and basics of coding.

firstly, what is coding?
	Coding is like a communication language , which sends human instructions to computers , this coding data is sent to hardware level as 01's which is machine language. Machine can understand only 01 , 0 means False and 1 means True. the code which is written changed into machine language and it is understood by computers. 
	in coding we have different levels of languages, we use high level programming language which can be understood by humans. in low level language , the function names and the syntax of code is understood by humans.
	so for this we use high level language and in this there are so many languages
		python, ruby, html, php, perl, R, java , c , c#, c++, etc
